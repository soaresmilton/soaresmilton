Welcome to my GitHub profile.

Currently I have been working on several different projects, building my personal brand called SM Code.

SM Code is an agency that aims to automate small business tasks.
Our mission is to add value to customers, taking their identity and space as a priority.
Our value comes down to: If we can help at least one person, our effort is being rewarded

In addition, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Catholic University of Santos.

I am currently learning about the entire JavaScript ecosystem, studying both Front-End technologies for Web development and NodeJS to act on the server side. In addition, I am interested and intent on learning about: UI / UX Design, SEO, Digital Marketing, Data Structure, Docker, among other subjects and technologies.

Curiosities: Besides being passionate about codes and programming languages, I love RPG games, classic books, comedy series and good beers.
