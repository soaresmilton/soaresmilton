Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I have a bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering, however, since January 2020, after my graduation, I got to know the world of programming with Python and completely fell in love with this area.

Since then, I started to study about technologies and every day I identify myself more with this career. Despite having passed a difficult year and being still for a long time, I returned to my studies in October.

I redesigned my studies, and now I study assiduously the concepts to become a Web developer. In addition, I develop systems using VBA in Excel and Access
