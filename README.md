Welcome to my GitHub profile.

Currently I have been working on several different projects, building my personal brand called SM Code.
SM Code is an initiative in which I seek to disseminate information, content and quality service regarding programming, so that the maximum number of people have a good experience with the world of technology. I define my mission as: "If I can help at least one person, all my effort will be paying off."

 Through the SM Code, I show the projects and studies that I have been practicing and developing in order to improve my technical skills in programming, as well as my development in some <em> soft skills </em> necessary for the job market, such as: communication , visibility, courage, determination and proactivity.

I have a bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Catholic University of Santos, I am completely passionate about programming, games, movies and beers.

I am currently learning about the entire JavaScript ecosystem, studying both Front-End technologies for Web development and NodeJS to act on the server side. In addition, I am interested and intent on learning about: UI / UX Design, SEO, Digital Marketing, Data Structure, Docker, among other subjects and technologies.
