### Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am currently learning about the entire JavaScript ecosystem, studying both Front-End technologies for Web development and NodeJS to act on the server side. In addition, I am interested and intent on learning about: UI / UX Design, SEO, Digital Marketing, Data Structure, Docker, among other subjects and technologies.

In parallel with my studies, I have worked on several projects, building my personal brand, called <strong>SM Code</strong>.

SM Code is an agency that <strong>aims</strong> to automate small business tasks.
Our <strong>mission</strong> is to add value to customers, taking their identity and space as a priority.
Our <strong>value</strong> comes down to: If we can help at least one person, our effort is being rewarded.

In addition, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Catholic University of Santos.

.

Curiosities: Besides being passionate about codes and programming languages, I love RPG games, classic books, comedy series and good beers.
